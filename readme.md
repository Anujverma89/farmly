# Farmly (Your Friend In Need)  
### Over View :-   
- We have used Django for our mini project, Which is python library used for web developmnet.  
- In this particular project we provide the input to the model using UI and the disease realted to sugarcane is displayed to the user in the UI.  
### How this functionality is achieved.  
- First we have provided the UI through which farmer can upload the image of crop(Sugarcane), which is developed using HTML5, CSS & Javascript along with some libraries like bootstrap and jquery.   
- Next when your image get's uploaded the button(Diagnose crop) becomes active.  
- 3)When you click on diagnose button it will send image to model for processing.  
- 4)Once model finishes the processing it will output the result as name of disease or healthy crop on the UI.
